# ProofIt
**Project Name: ProofIt - Habit Accountability App**

## **Objective**
ProofIt is a mobile application designed to help users stay accountable for their daily habits. Unlike traditional habit trackers, ProofIt requires users to post photo proof of their completed habit, making accountability more transparent. The app integrates social features where friends can view each other's progress and be notified of missed days. Users can also create a persona (an animal avatar) that reacts to their habit streaks, further gamifying personal development.

## **Project Idea**
The core idea of ProofIt is to make habit tracking more engaging and accountable. Users set personal habits such as going to the gym, reading, or walking outside. Each day, they post a photo as proof of their activity. Friends can see and comment on these posts, and failure to post results in a visible missed day notification. To enhance motivation, the app includes gamified elements such as streak tracking, leaderboards, and animated avatars that celebrate successes or react to failures.

## **Features**

### **1. Habit Tracking & Proof Submission**
- Users can set habits they want to track.
- Daily photo proof submission required.
- Option to add a caption to explain the proof.
- Publicly visible habit status (completed/missed).

### **2. Social Accountability & Community**
- Friends list to track each otherâ€™s progress.
- Friends receive a notification when a user misses a day.
- Comments and reactions on habit posts.
- Leaderboard showing top streak holders.

### **3. Avatar Customization & Gamification**
- Users select an animal persona upon signup.
- Avatars react based on streak success or failure.
- Accessories unlockable via habit streaks.
- Optional paid accessories for further customization.

### **4. Notifications & Reminders**
- Push notifications reminding users to post their proof.
- Daily streak reminders.
- Encouraging messages for long streaks.

### **5. Security & Privacy**
- End-to-end encryption for user data.
- Option to restrict posts to only friends.
- No ability to fake images (must be captured live via the app).

### **6. Future Improvements**
- AI-powered proof verification (e.g., object detection to validate photo content).
- Habit analytics and insights (e.g., trends, best habit formation strategies).
- Group accountability challenges.
- Integration with wearable devices for passive habit tracking.
- Web dashboard version.

## **Development Stack**

### **Front-End**
- **Framework:** React (React Native for mobile development)
- **State Management:** Redux or React Context API
- **Navigation:** React Navigation
- **UI Components:** TailwindCSS (if using React Native with NativeWind)

### **Back-End**
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (utilizing AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB where applicable)
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito or Firebase Auth
- **Storage:** AWS S3 (for storing proof submission photos and videos)
- **Database:** DynamoDB (NoSQL for structured data such as user and habit metadata)
- **Real-time Data:** AWS AppSync for GraphQL or Firebase Firestore for real-time updates
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify or AWS EC2 for backend services

### **Logic & API Development**
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI Features (Future):** TensorFlow/PyTorch for proof validation (optional AI features)
- **Microservices:** If needed, Docker-based services deployed on AWS Lambda

### **Package Management & DevOps**
- **Package Manager:** Yarn
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch for logs & performance tracking
- **Testing Framework:** Jest for React, PyTest for Python backend

## **Development Workflow**
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize React Native project with Yarn
   - Set up AWS backend infrastructure
   - Configure authentication and storage services

2. **Feature Development**
   - Build core front-end UI components
   - Implement backend logic for habit tracking
   - Develop API endpoints for proof submission & retrieval
   - Integrate AWS S3 for image/video storage and DynamoDB for habit/user data

3. **Integration & Testing**
   - Connect front-end with backend services
   - Test user flows and security measures
   - Deploy to staging environment for beta testing

4. **Deployment & Scaling**
   - Deploy the app to App Store and Google Play
   - Monitor performance and optimize API calls
   - Add additional features based on user feedback

## **Conclusion**
ProofIt aims to make habit tracking fun, engaging, and social. By leveraging AWS for backend scalability and Python for AI-powered habit verification, the app will provide a seamless user experience. Future improvements will focus on increasing automation, analytics, and AI-based validation to enhance the accountability process. The initial goal is to build a robust MVP (minimum viable product) with core functionalities and expand based on user feedback.

**Next Steps:**
- Finalize UI wireframes and user flow diagrams.
- Assign roles and responsibilities among developers.
- Begin front-end and backend setup concurrently.

Letâ€™s build an engaging habit tracker that keeps people accountable and motivated! ðŸš€
